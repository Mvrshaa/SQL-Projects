### Overview
This project provides an analysis of employee data from a Human Resources (HR) database. It focuses on various metrics such as employee demographics, job titles, location, tenure, and turnover rates. SQL queries and Power BI visualizations are used to present actionable insights for workforce planning, diversity, and retention strategies.

### Data Source:
[HR Employee Dataset](https://data.world/mesum/rwfd-curated/workspace/file?filename=Human+Resources.csv) 

### Key Concepts:
- **Data Cleaning**: Removal of records with invalid ages (e.g., negative values).
- **Data Filtering**: Only employees aged 18 and above were considered.
- **Termination Dates**: Excluded future termination dates from analysis.
- **SQL Techniques**: GROUP BY, ORDERBY, CASE statements.

### Tools Used:
- MySQL
- [Power BI](https://github.com/Mvrshaa/SQL-Projects/blob/main/HR-SQL-PowerBI/HR_Employee_Dashboard.pbix) for data visualization 


### Insights:
- Employee age distribution
- Departmental turnover rates
