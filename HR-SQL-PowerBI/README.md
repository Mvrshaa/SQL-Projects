## Project Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of employee data from the HR database to uncover insights into various aspects of the workforce. By leveraging SQL queries and Power BI for visualization, we aim to enhance human resource management, workforce planning, and diversity initiatives.

## Objectives

1. **Demographic Analysis**: Understand gender, race, and age distributions to assess workforce diversity.
2. **Turnover Insights**: Analyze employee turnover rates and trends to identify potential issues affecting retention.
3. **Location & Department Distribution**: Investigate the distribution of employees across different locations and departments to optimize resource allocation.
4. **Workforce Trends**: Identify trends in employee growth, tenure, and demographic shifts to inform strategic planning.
5. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Provide actionable insights to support HR policies, recruitment strategies, and workforce development initiatives.

## Data Source

- **Data**: HR Data with over 22,000 rows from the year 2000 to 2020.
- **Data Cleaning & Analysis**: MySQL Workbench
- **Data Visualization**: Power BI

## Data Cleaning

Key data-cleaning steps included handling null values, formatting date types, and ensuring accurate age calculations.

## Key Insights

1. **Gender Distribution**: A balanced workforce with slight male predominance.
2. **Race Representation**: Certain races are underrepresented, with White being the most dominant.
3. **Age Ranges**: Majority of employees fall within the 25-34, 35-44, and 45-54 age ranges.
4. **Turnover Rates**: Identified departments with higher turnover rates, signaling potential issues.
5. **Location Concentration**: Most employees are located in Ohio.

## Limitations

1. **Data Quality**: Accuracy depends on the underlying data quality, with some records excluded due to negative age values.
2. **Scope of Analysis**: Focused on specific metrics, which may not encompass all relevant workforce factors.
3. **Interpretation of Results**: Insights can be subjective and require context for accurate interpretation.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into workforce dynamics, informing future HR policies and strategies. By understanding employee demographics, turnover, and trends, organizations can foster a more inclusive and effective workforce.
